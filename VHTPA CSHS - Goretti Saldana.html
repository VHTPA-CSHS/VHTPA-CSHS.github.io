<h2>What is CSHS?</h2>
<p>“Computer Science Honors Society,” most commonly recognized as VHTPA CSHS is a student-run honors society in Dr. Richard A. Vladovic Harbor Teacher Preparation Academy. This honors society is much more rigorous and extensive than a regular computer science club as it teaches several more concepts and ideas regarding this field of study. The main focus for this club is to teach its community (Wilimington) about the several branches of computer science, and how it correlates to engineering and technology. VHTPA CSHS firmly believes that computer science is our present and future, therefore, everyone should be informed about the influence computer science has on their world.  </p>
<br>
<h2>What is its objective?</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, the main objective of this club is to inform its community about the impact of computer science in our past, present, and future. Computer Science has rapidly expanded across the entire globe and reached the smallest of regions. Computer science is a universal language in which we can all mutually communicate and execute our ideas. Without computer science, our world wouldn't have evolved to what it is today; we would be unable to enjoy the several commodities we all so naturally indulge in. Within a couple of years, computer science will not only be a subject within our world but the fundamental basis of it. VHTPA CSHS promotes the spread of healthy learning habits regarding Computer Science as it is better to be informed today than tomorrow. </p>
<br>
<h2>What will you learn in VHTPA CSHS?</h2>
<p>Forming a part of this club will allow you to learn the several key aspects of computer science, technology, and engineering. Dr.Richard A. Vladovic HTPA is a STEAM-based school, therefore, being inclusive of all career aspects. VHTPA greatly promotes the learning of technology and engineering since they are our present and near future. Joining this club will also allow you to learn the three main languages of code essential to our world-wide technological communication. </p>
