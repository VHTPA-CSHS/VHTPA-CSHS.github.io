# VHTPA's Computer Science Honors Society ('23/'24)

### Welcome to our website! (created by our lovely members <3)

## FOR THOSE NEW TO GITHUB:

GitHub Pages is ***REALLY SLOW!*** All content updated towards the website has to take time to be aproved. So do not rush certain things, talk with one another about when you are going to put additions to the website, and make it creative! For those who need information about the website:
- The website is suppose to promote as well as give information about CSHS!
- Use projects that you guys have made to show off CSHS!
- This is mainly all you guys! We will be doing minimal contributions, so show off your skills! :)
