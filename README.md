# VHTPA's Computer Science Honors Society ('23/'24)

### Welcome to our website! (created by our lovely members <3)

## FOR THOSE NEW TO GITHUB:

GitHub Pages is ***REALLY SLOW!*** All content updated towards the website has to take time to be aproved. So do not rush certain things, talk with one another about when you are going to put additions to the website, and make it creative! For those who need information about the website:
- The website is suppose to promote as well as give information about CSHS!
- Use projects that you guys have made to show off CSHS!
- This is mainly all you guys! We will be doing minimal contributions, so show off your skills! :)

# THINGS TO CHANGE FOR THE WEBSITE <- Jude's oppinion

- ***FIX THE TEXT***! all the text is either overlappnig with other elements within the website or the text is basically "wall to wall", not having any spacing within each line
- STOP USING THE br ELEMENT!!!! using br multiple times is very inneficient, makes the code look terrible, and is just nasty to look at. Use either (magin: #px) within the style sheet to create the gap between each element. Its better for those who are going to go into computer science as well as just making a personal website
- please, please, PLEASE dont make it look bare bones. Make it unique! The white background with the text just looks like you are just starting out. Decorate the website iteself, change the formating of the nav bar so it fits the astetic of CSHS. Just go crazy!
- Although I love the animations that we implemented into the website, try and make or use different animations. CSS actually has implemented animations under the main code "@keyframes". But its up to you guys on what you want to do.
- change the font. find fonts online and implement them into the website! You are not bounded by the default fonts that all computers have, but you can implement them so you can personalize them more!
- understand how to use colors within a website [VERY DIFFICULT]. <- this is more of a personal bias (although the blue as well as black works well with one another, try and find other ways to implement a variety of colors within the website)
