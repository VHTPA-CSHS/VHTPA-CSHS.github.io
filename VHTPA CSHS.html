<h2>What is CSHS?</h2>
<p>“Computer Science Honors Society,” in VHTPA, most commonly recognized as CSHS, is a student-led honors society that embraces our community’s technological and computer-based functions. CSHS is considered a more rigorous academic organization than other clubs as it requires greater student commitment, dedication, and participation than is regularly expected. CSHS mainly focuses on aspects related to coding and skills acquired through the “Exploring Computer Science” and “AP Computer Science” classes offered at the school. 
CSHS is an honor society intended to promote knowledge and comprehension of an essential aspect of the world we all live in. There are no barriers in this honors society as we all communicate through code, a mutual language.</p>
<br>
<h2>What is its objective?</h2>
<p>The main objective of CSHS is to inform its community about the past, present, and most importantly, the future impact of computer science in our world. Computer science is rapidly expanding globally, and all individuals need to have a clear understanding of the world they are living in. Computer science allows individuals to execute and share their ideas with the world, neglecting barriers or stereotypes. We all need to comprehend we would be unable to indulge in the common commodities of the world without the expansion of computer science throughout the world. 
 Soon, computer science will not just be a branch of study or a topic taught at school, but the fundamental base of our society. VHTPA CSHS intends to spread adequately formed ideas regarding computer science to all, as it is better to comprehend this topic today than tomorrow. </p>
<br>
<h2>What will YOU do in VHTPA CSHS?</h2>
<p>Your role as a member of this club allows you to participate in several activities regarding healthy computer science habits and executing creative ideas through code. The board members of this club will teach you about several aspects of computer science you may be unaware of, and you will also have the opportunity to teach those less knowledgeable about the topic as well. This club provides its members with the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity to code and program websites and apps, leading them to grow their technological abilities and skills. 
 VHTPA is a STEAM-based school that greatly promotes the aspect of Technology and its many functions in the world. </p>
